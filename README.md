TiltSpot (Learning Project)
========================

TiltSpot demonstrates the use of the accelerometer and geomagnetic field
sensors to  determine the device orientation.  It includes both text views
to display the current orientation angles (azimuth, pitch, roll), and spots
on each edge of the device to indicate which edge is tilted "up."  If the
device is rotated from portrait to landscape (or vice versa) TiltSpot
handles the rotation and draws the spots in the right places.

This is the Project after following the [guide](https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-advanced-course-practicals/unit-1-expand-the-user-experience/lesson-3-sensors/3-2-p-working-with-sensor-based-orientation/3-2-p-working-with-sensor-based-orientation.html)

It was tested on a Virtual Google Phone and a real Samsung A53.
